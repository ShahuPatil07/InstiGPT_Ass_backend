# Email Authentication [MERN Stack]
### Introduction
This project is a web application that provides email authentication functionality. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts securely. The user data is stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose, and the front-end is built using EJS templates with Bootstrap for styling.
### Technology Stack
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user data. Data is getting stored in MongoDB Compass.
* Express.js: A Node.js framework for building the backend server.
* Node.js: A runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.
* EJS: A templating engine for rendering dynamic content on the server-side.
* Bootstrap: A front-end framework for responsive web design.
### Running the code
* Clone the Git Repository.
* Navigate to the app folder in terminal.
* Run the command npm install
* Run npm start or run the [app.js](https://github.com/ShahuPatil07/InstiGPT_Ass_backend/blob/main/app.js) file.

### Journey of the assignment()
* Authentication was one of the tasks i think i could finish up pretty quick but that was defnitely not the case. Initially I tried to do the email auth thing in python (Django) (My managers suggested me lol). But gradually i realised that working in Javascript for the entire project would be better than multiple languages. Instead of the learning entire MERN stack, i thought of skipping right over to the Auth part. watched a lot of tutorials which used Eexpress.js framework but kept changing resource untill i felt I am actually learning something. setting up MongoDB was quite tough for some reason. scratching my head i took help of some of my co-conveners in setting up Mongo. Once setup was done, it wasn't that difficult. Also just to mention,  I have develpoed level 1 Authentication without any API keyswhich is obviously not the most standard way but that's what happens when there is work load of WnCC and you are new to the whole Backend world. But I guess this is wat defines my interest in this project for which i also had to pull off some all nighters. I had an idea how we can add sessions to our note keeper but again due to above mentioned reasons, it was a bit tough to implement all of this.
